# Changelog

Every release's changes, and a **Migration notes** section for each ([docs/releasing.md](docs/releasing.md)).

## 0.5.0 (unreleased)

### Changes

- **Delivery guarantees, written down and checked.** [docs/guarantees.md](docs/guarantees.md) says
  what `send()` resolving means, what is ordered, and where messages are sent once or at least once.
  `npm run test:conformance` runs every channel adapter Flow Framework ships through those
  guarantees (on demand and before each release; not part of `npm test`).
- **Flow Messaging sends resolve once the channel has the message** (`message.sent`), not on Flow's
  `202`: the agent's next message waits for it, its send tool says `delivered` only then, and a
  `message.failed` comes back from that send as Not delivered. New options
  `flowMessaging({ waitFor: "sent" | "delivered" | "queued", waitTimeoutMs })`.
- A send may resolve with a `SendReceipt` (`sent`, `delivered`, `queued`, `unconfirmed`); providers'
  `sendMessage`, `sendCarousel` and `sendTemplate` may return one. A send whose provider gave up
  waiting (`unconfirmed`) emits the new event `message.slow` and is never sent again.
- `ChannelInfo` has `templates` and `typing`. `templates: false` (SMS, Telegram, iMessage) refuses a
  template before it goes, with Flow Messaging's own `content.type` error; `typing: false` (SMS, a
  `whatsapp()` provider with no `typing`) is never sent a typing indicator.

### Migration notes

- **Flow Messaging sends wait for `message.sent`.** A send now takes until the channel accepted it
  (usually well under a second, at most `waitTimeoutMs`, 30 s by default). On a webhook, add
  `message.sent` to the endpoint's `events`, or each send reads its message back and takes up to a
  second longer. To keep 0.4's behaviour: `flowMessaging({ waitFor: "queued" })`.
- **A template on SMS, Telegram or iMessage is refused, not failed.** It used to fail at the send
  (a "Not delivered" note, a nudge `failed`); it is now refused before it goes (`message.refused`, a
  nudge `refused`). Code that watched for the failure watches for the refusal.
- **`Channel.send`, `Deliver` and the providers' send methods return `Promise<void | SendReceipt>`.**
  A provider that returns nothing keeps working unchanged. Code that calls a channel's `send` itself
  and declares its result as `Promise<void>` changes the type to `Promise<void | SendReceipt>`.
